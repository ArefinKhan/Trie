# Trie

In trie1.cpp, we show a simple trie implementation using array. We put a special character (in this case I have put '$') to denote a root node. Ideally this is an empty node with 26 children corresponding to 26 alphabets. We assume that the input characters are all lowercase alphabets (uppercase alphabets would not have been a problem either, just calling toLower() would do the trick!).
